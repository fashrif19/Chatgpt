This repository contains a simple web application that lets users obtain their geographic location using the browser's geolocation API and display it on an interactive map.

## Running the GIS location app

1. Open `gis_app/index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Click **Get Location** to allow the browser to fetch your coordinates.
3. Your latitude and longitude will appear and a map will center on your location.

The app relies on the Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap tiles which are loaded from the internet when the page is opened.
